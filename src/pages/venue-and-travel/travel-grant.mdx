For those who have difficulties raising fund for travel to host city(or country) for attending UbuCon Asia, The Committee provides travel grant for selected applicants.

Travel grant application is now open and you may submit one if you need funding from us. If you're submitting application as a proposal submitter(speaker), make sure to submit by deadline of call for proposals.

Please note that since our budget is always limited, we won't be able to approve application from everyone. We'll be accepting in order with our own priority. 
So, Depending on your Ubuntu and opensource community involvement, Your contribution on UbuCon Asia(this event), and other factors, We may approve full or partial grant or reject your application.
